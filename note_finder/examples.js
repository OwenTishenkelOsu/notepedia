You will be measuring the rate of photosynthesis in spinach leaves using the instrument DPIP. Please carefully read all instructions in the lab manual and also periodically check Canvas for updates. Any questions that you have should be directed to the instructor during office hours or via email.\nThis lab report must be completed individually. You cannot work with others or use other resources (e.g., web sites, books, research papers, etc.) to complete the lab report.\nAnswer all the questions in the lab manual and submit a typed report to Canvas. You should also include a written explanation of your data analysis and results. The lab report and your answers must be typed; for example, in Microsoft Word, Google Doc, etc. Images and graphs should be properly labeled and inserted into the document.\nThis lab report must be submitted on time to receive credit. Late work will not be accepted unless arrangements have been made with the instructor prior to the due date.\nQuestion 1. [50 points]\nExplain the role of chlorophyll in the process of photosynthesis.\nChlorophyll is a pigment found in chloroplasts of plants that absorbs light energy from the sun. This energy is then used to drive the process of photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen. Chlorophyll is essential for this process as it is responsible for absorbing the light energy needed for photosynthesis to occur. Without chlorophyll, plants would not be able to produce the glucose they need to survive. Additionally, chlorophyll is also responsible for giving plants their green color, as it reflects green light.\n",

      "Department of Neuroscience\nLab Notes: Investigating the Effects of Neuromodulators on Neuron Function\nDate: Monday, February 7, 2023\nInstructor: Dr. Jane Smith\nTA: John Doe\n\nObjective:\nThe objective of this lab is to investigate the effects of different neuromodulators on the function of neurons. Students will perform experiments to observe the changes in neural activity, including changes in action potential frequency and amplitude, in response to various neuromodulator drugs.\n\nMaterials:\n- Microelectrodes\n- Neuromodulator drugs (serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, etc.)\n- Isolated neuron preparation (e.g. from a leech or snail)\n- Data acquisition and analysis software\n\nMethods:\n1. Prepare isolated neuron preparation by dissecting and removing non-neuronal tissue.\n2. Insert microelectrodes into the neuron to record action potentials.\n3. Apply different concentrations of neuromodulator drugs to the neuron.\n4. Observe changes in neural activity, including changes in action potential frequency and amplitude, in response to the neuromodulator drugs.\n5. Use data acquisition and analysis software to record and analyze the data.\n6. Write up lab report summarizing the results and conclusions.\n\nData Analysis and Results:\nThe results of the lab showed that the different neuromodulator drugs had varying effects on the function of the neuron. For example, the application of serotonin led to an increase in action potential frequency, while dopamine led to an increase in action potential amplitude. Acetylcholine had a more complex effect, leading to changes in both frequency and amplitude. These results demonstrate the importance of neuromodulators in regulating neural activity.\n\nConclusion:\nThe lab provided a hands-on investigation of the effects of neuromodulators on neuron function. Students were able to observe the changes in neural activity in response to different drugs and gain a deeper understanding of the role of neuromodulators in the nervous system. The results demonstrate the importance of neuromodulators in regulating neural activity and have implications for understanding and treating neurological disorders.\n",

Please carefully read all instructions below and also periodically\ncheck Slack for updates. Any questions that you post to the public Slack channels should NOT\ncontain any portion of your solution.

You also cannot use other\nresources (e.g., web sites, books, blogs, research papers, other people, etc.) to solve the problems.\nAnswer all the questions below and submit a single, typed pdf document to Canvas. For each\nquestion, you should also write a paragraph that summarizes how you went about solving the\nproblem. The questions and your answers must be typed; for example, in Latex, Microsoft Word,\nGoogle Doc, etc. Images may be scanned and inserted into the document if it is too complicated to\ndraw them properly, but you should make a concerted effort to create images in an application of\nyour choosing (e.g., Word, Powerpoint, Dia,...).\nThis assignment must be submitted on time to receive credit. No late work will be accepted,\nunless you have a prior arrangement with the instructor.\nQuestion 1. [30 points]\nGive the weights and bias for a McCulloch-Pitts (M-P) neuron that has the following:\n• Inputs: x, y and z\n• Output: is equal to z if x = −1 and y = 1, and is equal to -1 otherwise\nwx = -1, wy = 1, wz = 1, b = -3, such that - x + y + z - 3 = output\nI solved the problem with an equation, x+y+z+b=output, and logic. This equation needed to\nbe ≤0 for all values and only return 1 if each value was the correct amount, so the above solution\nresults in a 0 if and only if x is negative one, y is positive one, and z is positive one which results\nin the activation function returning 1 and -1 if z is negative one. If either x or y differs from\nthose values it will automatically return negative one as the function is only equal to zero under\nthe precise conditions x=-1, y=1, z=1.\n",
